# Session 1 implementation checkpoint

2026-11-05 · branch `feat/conquest-living-war-v1` · baseline GitHub main `a668e30`. Current checkpoint commit is the commit containing this file; resolve with `git log -1` / the PR head (a commit cannot contain its own SHA).

## Completed checkpoint 1 — combat thermal rescue

- Moonbeam no-core normal held fire: 29 real shots before first vent, 5s recovery; legal RoF core fixtures at levels 0/5/10: 25 shots. Thermal tradeoffs tested at -3/0/3, at 15/30/60 FPS: minimum 25. Canonical damage, .95s interval, independent projectile velocity/range retained. Other weapons now sustain longer differentiated bursts.
- Custom always-visible numeric thermal widget above FIRE, neutral/amber/red and VENTING, accessible meter semantics; no native meter. No free heat reset introduced.
- Entire unabridged two-session roadmap and smoothness contract archived together in CONQUEST_FLAGSHIP_V1.md.

## Evidence / limits

Executed PASS: `node dev/tests/conquest-living-war.mjs`, `node dev/tests/conquest-session-033.mjs`, `node dev/tests/conquest-authority.mjs`, `node dev/tests/conquest-controls.mjs`, `node dev/tests/conquest-session.mjs`, `node dev/tests/conquest-economy.mjs`. Full regression is running; browser Chromium verification is running. No gameplay/device smoothness claim yet. PHYSICAL_IPHONE_NOT_TESTED. Production unchanged; no merge/deployment. All data used by tests is isolated.

## Remaining mandatory scope

Session 1 A4–6 presentation/browser proof; B dense live region; C six distinct missions + persistent frontline; D physical tiered Command Base and modules/passive output/reputation; E progression, earned cosmetics and real affordability/3h model; F migration/concurrency; G full authenticated journey, performance and release gates. Exact requirements: SESSION_01_LIVING_WAR_FULL_CODEX_PROMPT.txt; Session 2 architecture contract retained in CONQUEST_FLAGSHIP_V1.md. Do not mark Session 1 complete or deploy partial work as the flagship.

## Resume next

1. Finish Chromium thermal/multitouch evidence and inspect thermal placement at both sizes; do not replace actual shot assertions with mocked state.
2. Extend deterministic world garrisons/opening patrols and six mission reducers in shared combat code; retain per-generation CAS rewards, physical proximity, active mission continuity.
3. Add central base/module definitions and server actions, physical base rendering and progression UI; calibrate actual earnings before release.

No schema changes at this checkpoint. No paid services, payments, account/Arcade/PvP or airdrop modifications. Open historical PRs #5 and #14–21 are unrelated; do not merge them. No preexisting living-war branch or active Conquest PR existed at start.
